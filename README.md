# miniCFM: a miniature, lightweight version of the **Community Firn Model (CFM)**

miniCFM is a small version of the Community Firn Model. It is designed to simulate transient firn density and temperature in a limited (fixed) number of layers. This makes it appropriate for coupling to an ice sheet model as a surface boundary condtion.

Suggestions and improvements are welcome, via pull requests or issues.
